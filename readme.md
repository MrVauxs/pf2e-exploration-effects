# System compatability:

The module requires the PF2E system and a Foundry version of V10 or higher. There is a V9 version but it is no longer having new features added.

## Exploration Effects

**How to use:**

The effects do not need to be exported from compendiums to the items tab. 
Instead, there are two ways you can apply them to your characters.
- Individual effects can be dragged from the compendium to the macro bar. This will create a macro that will toggle the condition on a selected token when run. This is functionality provided by the core system. Use the macro a second time to remove the effect.
- Alternatively, you can use the provided Exploration Effects macro to open the compendium and drag one from there, allowing you to select any exploration activity while only using one macro slot. Remove the effect from the effects tab or the effects bar at the top right.

The module also includes macros for several different types of light source. You can use them as templates, modifying the colour and animations to suit your character's flavour.

If you don't want to keep the module enabled, you can make a copy of the compendiums to your world before you disable it to continue using the effects without needing to import them.

**Automation:**

Each effect includes no automation. This is because of the nature of these activities, which rely heavily on GM fiat and do not really take effect automatically. Instead, each one contains a link to the activity it relates to. You can send the effect to chat through your character sheet's effects tab to share them with other users.

Another benefit of having no automation is that in theory these effects should work fine even after the core system begins automating these rules itself. This means that they should remain functional without needing updates up until they are rendered obsolete by system updates.

Notably, the Defend activity is likely better served by an actual Raise Shield macro which provides AC automation, but I included it here because I wanted to be thorough.

**Why aren't all exploration activities included?**

This module only seeks to cover exploration activities which can be undertaken during travel. For instance, Treat Wounds or Refocus require you to tell your GM that you're stopping to take a break, and may also have rolls involved. Thus there's no reason to add an icon effect for them. However, with effects like Scout and Investigate, I find it's easy to forget to specify which one one is taking until it becomes relevant. 

This module allows players to silently notify their GM which downtime activity they are taking at any moment without needing to interrupt the flow of the game or the conversation. It also keeps the rules references to these activities within easy reach. I find it is especially helpful for quiet players who may be nervous about potentially interrupting narration or conversation to tell their GM their activity. It also removes some of the pressure from the GM to remember each players' choices.

The only absence is Squeeze, which I felt is not used for long enough periods of time to need an effect and moreover is only used in response to a specific hazard or environment. I did include an "unspecified" effect which can be used for on-the-fly activities or used as a template for creating new ones, although in reality this is quite trivial to do even without a template.

# Auras

The module contains eight simple template auras with no automation to facilitate on-the-fly play. They measure 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 feet respectively. They can be added directly to the character, or via a ChoiceSet rule element on the Flexible Auras effect item that is also included.

I recommend dragging the Flexible Auras effect to your hotbar and using it to access the various sizes via the popup window, which looks like this:

# Licensing and Credits:

The effects contain no rules content or artwork of their own. Instead they reference rules content and image assets which are already present within the Foundry system. 

The excellent maps in the preview pictures are from the very talented Narchy's remake of the Abomination Vaults maps, which can be found [here](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/av-maps-remake-by-narchy).
