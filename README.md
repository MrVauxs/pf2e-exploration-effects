**System compatability:**

As Effects items, these will break on any system other than PF2E. I don't know why you'd try that, though.

**How to use:**

The effects do not need to be exported from compendiums to the actors tab. Instead, they can be dragged from the compendium to the macro bar. This will create a macro that will toggle the condition on a selected token when run. 

**Automation:**

Each effect includes no automation. This is because of the nature of these activities, which rely heavily on GM fiat and do not really take effect automatically. Instead, each one contains a link to the activity it relates to. You can send the effect to chat through your character sheet's effects tab to share this with other users.

Another benefit of having no automation is that in theory these effects should work fine even after the core system begins automating these rules itself. This means that they should remain functional without needing updates up until they are rendered obsolete by system updates.

**Licensing:**

The effects contain no rules content or artwork of their own. Instead they reference rules content and image assets which are already present within the Foundry system.
